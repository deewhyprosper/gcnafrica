<h3 style=" text-align: center; color: red; padding-right: 10%; padding-left: 10%;">
 			Our platform is an integration of the best of multimedia interactive technology designed to solve the following critical challenges prevalent in a standard classroom environment.
 		</h3><br>

 <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">ACCESS TO OUTSTANDING TEACHING CONTENT</h3>
 <p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">Our interactive platform comes fully loaded with over 5000 resources, clip arts and slides to literarily teach any subject. This is a huge saving for all educational agencies as huge savings are made on wasteful printing of static educational flip charts or resources that are not only inadequate but do not make strong impact on teaching in the classroom.  The interactive solution is also an open resource that can still be uploaded with local interactive resources generated by the teacher on field trips to support teaching and learning.<br><br>

The star board also has the unique ability to be linked directly to any global educational gateway or digital library anywhere in the world via the internet and bring right into the classroom any slides, videos, graphs, pictures or clips that will help teaching and learning.<br><br>

Imagine a Geography class on hurricanes, how do we explain this using static printed graphs as compared to getting on an interactive multimedia video clips of how a hurricane is formed; and even play clips of a typical hurricane and how it impacted the environment it took place? This is a more dynamic and fully engaging, and will make a stronger impact on students learning.<br></p>
	   		

<h3 style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">BUILDING ATTENTION SPAN FOR STUDENTS</h3>
 <p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">The new generation of “play station” learners we have running through our schools today are very restless and easily distracted, hence they need an engaging and interactive platform to keep them focused to learn anything. The platform comes with a fully interactive board with a pen that has over 77 colours and also has the unique capability of recording whatever the teacher says and writes in the classroom.<br><br>

This unique feature plays back what the teacher had taught in class for students’ review and for clearer understanding of the subject. This enables everyone to learn at their own individual bound since the recorded class sessions can be reviewed and accessed by the students from anywhere and at any point in time. <br><br>

With this solution, teachers will have more quality time to engage and interact with the students in class since no teacher needs be repeating and re-writing same material all the time. <br><br>

The same content can be stored over time and also become a repository of resources for students to revise independently and review courses prior to examinations. The idea is to create an unfettered access for every student to be able to learn and achieve from anywhere at any point in time.<br></p>
	   		

 <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;">SKILL GAPS OR SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS</h3>
 <p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">With the ability of the platform to record what the teacher writes or says in the classroom, it will be very easy for teachers to share best practice, using those teachers that have evolved a vibrant approach to teaching a particular subject. With this platform, teachers can mentor each other and can also create peer reviews and resource sharing. <br><br>

Interestingly, the content as taught by a teacher in a school can be transmitted at real time to another class in a visible or remote location where the expertise to teach that subject is unavailable, inadequate or where the cost of managing such a location might be high or dangerous to physically access.<br></p>

 <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;">QUALITY ASSURANCE</h3>
 <p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">This is a very critical challenge in teaching and learning. Being able to objectively assess a teacher and also track students’ understanding of what is taught in class is a major challenge to benchmarking best practice.<br><br>

With our platform having the robust capability of recording all what is said and taught in the classroom and archived, it makes it easier to assess what a teacher has taught after a class session. With this capability, it will be quite easy for a quality assurance team to ascertain gaps in teaching and quickly make corrections before the students fails the subject. This will also endear best practice and team building or peer mentoring as teachers with excellent teaching skills can now be benchmarked to assist other teachers who are falling behind.<br><br>

Also with the students’ voting/response system we can identify students that are falling behind in the class almost on a daily basis and quickly identify the root cause and proffer solutions immediately, as student can be easily and quickly assessed after each class session.

<p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">A central systems data management unit will be set up at the school’s ICT office to collect data in real time and interpret immediately for appropriate action. For example, on a daily basis the unit will deliver the following; <br>
1. How many students attended class across all the centres.<br>
2. How many teachers were in school, what course they taught and at what time.<br>
3. Scores students’ performance(s) in each class and grade them per centre and across all centres.<br>
4. Management: Often times, coordinating a mega project from a public sector perspective could be extremely challenging, especially, a project that is meant to deliver information, data and critical resources on a daily basis. This challenge has crippled many very promising educational projects across the country. With benefit of hindsight we have been able to evolve a private-public sector partnership package that ensures sustainability of the project over time to ensure it delivers the anticipated value to all stakeholders. All data and information gotten from point 1-4 will be linked up to the school e-learning platform. Also, we can provide a service level agreement upon which we ensure effective management of the project.<br>
5. Training /Capacity Building: The biggest challenge to raising and sustaining standards is the quality of teachers that will drive the process. When the teachers are skilled and adequately equipped to embrace best practice in teaching. The flagship of this deployment is the setting up of the first virtual Cambridge-Hitachi teacher training academy in Nigeria. This center will boast of a robust faculty of international experts on teaching and learning and shall deliver bespoke training across pedagogy with special emphasis on ICT in education and the use of interactive resources for teaching and learning.
Undoubtedly, this shall be the first truly well-equipped teachers’ training center.
